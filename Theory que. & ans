INTRO:- 
Q1. What is cloud computing?
-It deliver on demand computing services server ,storage ,database,application, networking tools and its resources over the internet.
-All are these services present at remote location anywhere and anytime.
-We take these service via internet.So disadvantage of cc is without internet we can`t able to acces cloud services.
-When you want to use those services you are going to pay for these services.
-When you are done using it when you no need for services you are not going to pay anymore.
-So basically Cloud give you really nice interface you can easily access.]
-Like tarditional way you need servers ,manpower to handle these serers ,cooling system,all network devices,hardware if your website grows you need more servers. 
-In CC you no need all those resources only required internet to acess all those cloud services.
-You Paid fornonly cloud service that we used.

Q2. So why we use regions.
-to solve latency problem like suppose you are in mumbai region when you search and website and that website hosted in another region like canada. so it takes 
time to response . But any person in canada region and he serach web within second response it. Bcz region is near.
-when you hosted any website in near by region. And whenever you search web it response it within sec. Choosing a region close to your users can reduce latency.

Q3. Deployment Model in Cloud ?
--> Public Cloud:- Available to everyone to store & access data via internet
    private cloud:- It is not accessible publically 
                    It is secure than Public bcz all data within pvt cloud are private only authorize people access data.
                    suppose that any organisation create private cloud and services/data is availbale within an oraganisation so it means data accessible to those peoples who are in oragainisation.
    Hybrid Cloud :- It is an mixture of Pvt cloud & public cloud
                    If you want to store data privately or more securable & aceesible to only authorize peoples then use pvt cloud in hybrid
                    If you want to data are acceesible to publically then store into public cloud.
    Community Cloud:- It allows service within cloud are accessible to group of organisation
                      A group of organisation create.
                      all data/services within cloud are accessible/share to group of organisation.

Q4.Service Model in Cloud ?
--> IAAS :- Infrastructure as a service (EC2)
            For running an application we take infra like vm, server, storage, networking tools from cloud
            
    PAAS :- plateform as service (LAMBDA)
            It provides plateform for developers develop deploy manage application
            We develop/run manage application rather than all services are arrange by cloud service providers.
            virtualisation, storage, servers, networking arrange by cloud provider
    SAAS :- software as a service, 
            It delivers an software application over internet. users access apllication form web browsers
            We only use application & pay.

    106 Availability zones in 32 region. Each Region has many max 6 or min 3 Az.

Q7. What is service ? & What are resources ?
--. You know that AWS provide huge amount of services to use end users
    for storage, virtualmachines, for netwroking, databses
    to create machines, use storage for that we use an services
    resources nothing but an entity which are present in service like buckets is reosurces of S3 service

AWS EC2:- 

Q59.What is EC2, Why do we need EC2 service in cloud computing ?
-->With help of EC2 we cretae an virtual machine called as instances in EC2.
   Bcz it provide scalability, fault tolerance, high availability with help of different resources.
   We have only pay for what we use.
   Anytime we create instances when we no need after that simply delete that m/c.

Q60.Features of Amazon EC2 ?
-->it provide different types of machine we create as own requirement on the basis work loads.
   On our demand we scale up & scale down on our demand.
   We also choose different price model as our requirement.
   
Q61.What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
--> It is an software that creates and runs virtual machines on hardware
    Types Bare metal and Hosted
    Bare metal means these hypervisors run directly on hardware without need any OS.
    we use Xzen in AWS,
    Hosted means it runs on OS. SO it will takes hardware resources from host OS. EX:- Virtual Box.
                      
Q62.Where we use hypervisor
--> on hardware to run machine.

Q63.Steps to create an EC2 instance.
--> Give name of instance 
    Choose AMI as our requirement AMI decide os like Redhat,ubuntu,linux
    Choose instance types like how many cpu, ram we required.

    And data are stored in the form of blocks and os runs on these root volumes.
    General purpose SDD 
    Provisioned IOPSSDD
    Throughput HDD 

Q73.Purpose of Using EBS volumes ?
--> It is an network level storage 
    Persistent 
    As our own requirement we increase and decrease size.
    It is easy to take backup (snapshot)
    It easy to detach and attach to another instance no chances to data lost.
    
Q74.How many types of purchasing options do we have in aws ec2 ?
-->  On demand- 
     Dedicated host
     Dedicated instance 
     Spot instance
     Reserved instance

Q75.Difference between AWS AMI Image & AWS Template ?
--> We create Template for autoscaling group it means when instance are created same replica \
    created which we are configured in template.    
    AWS AMI image means backup of software or volume
    suppose that you have instamce all webserver application are configured and you need another instance 
    with same configuration so why we need to waste time for creating another instance
    Create Image of existing instance after create instamce from AMI IMAGE. 

Q76.What is NIC & it’s types ?
--> 

Q77.What is elastic IP ? & WHY were we used ?
--> Elastic IP means static like it will not change over time when we stopped an EC2 machine
    bcz it will change when we stopped an ec2 m/c.

Q78.What is the snapshot of why we use it ?

    for backup purpose we use snapshot.

Q79.How can we save money in snapshot costing, if an automated snapshot has been created ?
--> Regularly review and delete snapshots that are no longer needed
    for save cost aws creates incremental snapshots    

Q80.What is the lifecycle manager in snapshot ?
--> suppose we have to take backup/snapshot of volumes daily,monthly,weekly
    For that create lifecycle manager policy defines time and frequency on the basis
    of policy it takes snapshot at given time.

Q81.How does the Amazon lifecycle manager work ?
--> we create policy and add volums with help of tags & defines frequency and time
    on the basis of frquency and given time it takes snapshot
    suppose we give frquency dailt specify time 9:00AM every day at 9:00AM snapshot will be created.

Q82.Difference between Security Group & NACL ?
--> SG work on instance level where nacl are stateless
    NACL work on subnet and VPC level where dg are stateful.

Q83.What are NACL & Its types ?
--> NACL are apply on subnet level so by default rules is apply to all instances which are in subnet.
    TYPES:- Default NACL & Custom NACL.
    When we create a New VPC so default NACL are created it allows for all inbound outbounf traffic.
    Where custom nacl are created by user as our requirement we also for inbound and outbound rules.

Q84.How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
--> Public and private.

Q85.How many types of volume states do we have ?
--> Creating
    available
    In use
    Deleting 
    Deleted.

Q86.What is a key pair, and its types ?
--> Key pair is an secure login information for of your instances
    with help of key pair we login an remote m/c on our local machine
    Public key and pvt key
    Public is stored to AWS and pvt key files is store on our local m/c.

Q87.What is load balancer and its types ?
--> load balancer distributes incoming web application traffic across multiple targets/instances in multiple AZ.
    Types :- classical, application, network and gateway.

Q88. How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
--> Whenever traffic comes on load balancer listeners check for connection request from clients with help of ports what you configured
    it will forward tarffic to registered targets using round robin algorithm.
    LB continously monitor instance health using ping if any instance is unhealthhy it will forward traffic to only healthy instances.
    

Q89. Features of Load Balancers ?
--> Provide fault taulerance and high availability
    ALB allows you to route traffic based on the URL path we mention path in listeners rule.
    In nlb maximum amount pass in minimum time

Q90. What is ASG ? & Its types ?
--> Basically ASG will decide desire, maximum, minimum size of autoscaling group.
    We wiil define capacity of instances as per our requirement we also give target values of cpu
    utilization. On the basis of that it will scale up and scale down targets when traffic increases.

Q91. What is a Health Check ?
--> It check healths of instance where an instance face any problem like software or hardware problem.

Q92. What is the threshold ?
--> it means specific value limit. Whenever it reaches value limit after action is performed.

Q93.What is the group of LB ?
--> It is an Target Groups
    Target Group nothing but an group of targets (lambda, instance, ALB)
    Target Groups are used with Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers.

Q94.Why do we prefer ALB over ALB ?
-->   

Q95.Difference between Web server & Application server ?
--> webserver:- 
    responsibility of a web server is to handle HTTP requests.
    webserver is serves only static content to end users\
    no need database connectivity bcz severs static content.
    example: apache http, nginx , A simple portfolio website with fixed content and no user interaction
Application server:- 
    responsibility of an application server is to execute application code and generate dynamic content based on client requests.
    The application server executes server-side code, processes dynamic requests, interacts with databases, and generates content based on user input.
    The application server communicates with the database to fetch or update information as needed.
    example :- apache tomcat, An e-commerce website with product listings, user accounts, and shopping cart functionality database to store product and user data.
  
Q96.What is the target group ?
--> When we use ALB at that time we have to create Target group
    We add targets (instances, lambda, alb) in target group, and add Target group ALB.
    
Q97.What is the desired capacity in ASG ?
--> It means minumim no of running servers when we launch ASG after it creates instances
    Suppose we have to give Desired capacity 2 so in every situation minimum 3 instances runs load will increase or decrease no matters.

Q98.How many types of the Scaling option ?
--> Vertical scaling
    Horizontal Scaling.

Q99.Scaling plans ?
--> 1] dynamic scaling - a]target tracking policy
                         b]simple scali9ng
                         c] step scaling
    2]schedule scalimg
    3]predictive scaling

Q100.Types Auto scaling
--> Dynamic scaling
    Predictive scaling 
    Schedule Scaling 

Q101.Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling ?
--> Vertical scaling:- we scale up manually existing instance rather than create replica of existing instance.
    Horizontal Scaling:- It means whenever traffic increses it will automatically scale up same replica of instance what will you configure in template

Q102.Difference between AMI & Snapshot ?
--> AMI consist of application servers and os which are need to create instances
    Snapshot is backup of only volumes.

Q103.What is difference between EBS/EFS/S3
--> EBS :- Ebs is an block level storage & block storage divide data into blocks
           OS are install in EBS & It is used in form of HDD and SSD.
           it is AZ specific
    EFS:- It is mount on instance and it can mount on more thatn 1 instance
          using efs we share files to all mounted instance
          it is an region specific
    S3:- It is an object level storage when we storage any object it will store as it is not divides into blocks
        We store meta data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VPC

Q104. What is VPC ?
--> Virtual Private Natework It means we create our own network which is isolated from other networks
    Only authorize peoples can access our network resources.

Q105. What are the Subnets when working with VPC ?
--> Subnets decide how many resources we are creates in VPC
    Subnets are a way to divide the IP address range of your VPC into smaller.
    Subnets are created in a specific availability zone

Q106. What is NAT Device ?
-->   Network addressing translate
     With help of NAT device instances within pvt subnets access services out side the vpc & get internet connectivity

Q107. What is the difference between stateful & stateless filtering ?
--> stateful means whenever you add any rule in inbound  are automatically added in outbound. 
    stateless means you add any rule in inbound after you also add in outbound not automatically added like stateful

Q108. What are the advantages of using default VPC ?
--> All are configured Route TABLES, Subnets, NACL,Route Tables.

Q109. What is the internet gateway in VPC ?
--> With help of IG reources within vpc are connect to Internet
    For that associate IG to route table means all traffic are redirect/going through IG.

Q110. What is Network ACL in VPC ?
--> NACl filter incoming traffic on your VPC/subnets
    It act as firewall controls incoming traffic on subnet level.

Q111. What is the Security Group in VPC ?
--> SG act as firewall on resources(EC2) within vpc

Q112. What is an Elastic IP Address in VPC, and why do we need to use, realtime example ?
--> It is an static IP doest no change over time.
    We attch Elastic IP to NAT GATEWAY.

Q113. Can we attach one Production Elastic IP to the new Prod server ?
--> 

Q114. How does ELB Affect a VPC ?
--> Improved avaibility and fault tolerance means ALB monitor instances which are healthy or not and forward request to healthy instances
    ELB evenly distributes incoming traffic among multiple EC2 instances.
    number of incoming requests increases, ELB can distribute the load across additional instances.
    ELB evenly distributes traffic across instances in all available Availability Zones.

Q115. What are the limitations of VPC’s, Gateway and subnets ?
--> 1 Gateway is attached to only 1 VPC.
    1subnet is associate with only 1 route table.

Q116 What is a Public IP Address and why do we use it ?
--> With help of Public IP address instances are connect to internet.

Q117. Explain Bastion Host Concept ?
--> Whenever We have to access Private subnet instances How we can access it bcz it doesnt have an public IP.
    At that time we access from Public Subnet instance through SSH. This concept called as Bastion Host.

Q118. When do we need to create a new customised VPC ?
